# Scrapp app: Predicting Packaging Parts and Materials

This repository contains the code used for my consultancy-style dissertation project. Data provided by the company is confidential, therefore is not included. 


The aim of this project is to investigate the packaging details of commercial products in order to improve the accuracy of Scrapp App, a mobile app that offers recycling guidelines to its users. The app provides recycling guidelines when users scan the products they want to recycle based on their location and local recycling rules. The most reliable packaging information of products comes directly from companies, but user input needs to be verified by the company specialist before being added to their database. This is a manual and time-consuming process that the company would like to automate. In order to check the accuracy of the submitted data, they would like to utilize their on-hand verified data. The on-hand data has several aspects that can be investigated and be useful for the app. This project focuses on modelling and predicting the packaging parts of products and the materials of these packaging parts.


The general info on the used model and findings can be found in [__poster.pdf__](https://github.com/tutkuc/scrapp-app-packaging-classification/blob/main/poster.pdf) . Please refer to [__report.pdf__](https://github.com/tutkuc/scrapp-app-packaging-classification/blob/main/report.pdf) for more details.
